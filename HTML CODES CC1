            <h2>About Me and My Family</h2>

            <p> 
            Personality is what makes us unique and special. Our character determines who we are and how different we are from others.
            It is possible to find people who have similar appearances, but we will never find identical personalities. 
            I am going to prove this by taking the example of my character. 
            My goals, my achievements, my favorite activities are exciting and differ from any other person has in this world.
            Positive attitude to everything that happens is my value number one.
            My family taight me that no matter what happens it is significant to prserve a sincre smile on our faces. 
            Even if something bad occurs, my mom Janice and my grandma Remedios told me to find something positive. 
            As long as we are alive, and I am alive, there should be something good in the surrounding world. 
            This philosophy helps me to be happy and satisfied with everything that I get.
            </p>

         </p>

 <p class="info">Family holds a special place in everyone's life. 
I love my family and can do anything for my family members.

                  <p>
                  I started playing volleyball when I was seven years old, my mom taught me during summer vacations.
                She used to play it back in high school, and ever since she taught me, it has been my passion. 
                 I think that for every athlete regarding the sport they play there are certain things that makes their sport special. 
               I fell in love with volleyball the second I got in the court, everything about it makes it amazing. 
              However, I believe the best gift the sport has given me are the friendships and memories that will last forever. 
             Every game is a new experience, and every team has different chacteristics were you learn from. 
                And this continuous flows on my veins like I can't stop what I've already started. I CAN'T STOP THE STIGMA !!!

                  <p>I used to take my dslr camera and have all of the view or pose as I snapped endless photos. 
                    My love for photography only grew from there. 
                    I was a very quiet person throughout school and photography gave me a voice and a way to express myself.
                    There are a million reasons why I love photography.

                  <h3>Believing in Yourself</h3>
                  <p class="info">Keep the fire burning <span>&bull;</span> 

                  <p>Almost everyone desires to be successful, everyone hopes to live a happy life, but how can we do that. 
                         I feel "believe in yourself" is the most important.

"Believe in yourself" means a positive attitude. 
When you wake up in the morning, open your eyes, draw the curtain, enjoy the first sunlight of the day. 
And tell yourself "Have a happy day". Just as professor Galbraith says, "You yourself decide whether you are happy today. 
Be sure you are happy today."

Like a lyric says, "I love the sun, it makes me be thoughtful;
I love the rain, it makes me be stronger and braver."
 This is so optimistic.

Then you go to work or study, do it with your full enthusiasm.
 You should overcome your shyness, your timidity and your tension. 
Be brave and get courage from your heart, face up to your challenges. 
Say to yourself, "I'll try it, and I will try my best."
Remember, no one can obstruct your progress.
 Believe in yourself, you can do it, you can manage it.
 Always share and show ideas with others, cooperate with others.

<b> Success needs your confidence, passion and positive attitude; 
living a happy life needs your confidence, passion and positive attitude. 
All this needs you to "believe in yourself"

So, believe in tomorrow, believe in dream, and believe in yourself!! </b>

                         I think special skills are a gift that you have to work hard to get. 
                         Everyone has a special skill some of mines are listed below. One is I'm very athletic. 
                          I love sports whether I'm watching them or playing them.
                         I am also a very determined, and hardworking kind of person,
                          I know want I want and I try my hardest to get it.
                          Another special skill that I have is that I am a very smart person. 
                          I am also a very good dancer.

                  I think my most special skill is I'm very athletic. 
                  I love to play sports they are my passion. 
                   I want to play sports for a living whether it's volleyball, badminton, or 
                  long jump if I could I would love to play all three. 
                  It would be such a dream come true if I could meet my 
                  favorite star let alone play with them. That's where my 
                  hard work and determination comes in to play.

                  My skill to work hard, and to be determined will be the key to my success in the future. 
                 The reason I believe that is because I know you have to work 
                 hard and never give up on your dreams if you want them to come true. 
                   I also know that because another one of my goals is to go to college, 
                 and in order to get into college you have to work hard and get good grades.
                 Playing sports is only a plus to get in to college, that also takes a lot of hard work and determination.
                    In order to achieve this you also have to be smart and I'm a smart person.
     My last major skill is that I am a smart person. I am not talking about being smart in school you can be smart in many other places about many other things in life such as money. You can go very far in life if you are smart all you have to do is pay attention and listen. I have many skills some better in life than others like my skill of being a good dancer. Dancing can't really get you far in life unless your goal is to become a professional dancer. Even for that you have to work hard be and determined, other than that it's exciting. You could even meet your favorite singer and maybe be in their video.

     These are my special skills and my opinion's on special skills, 
 <b> GOODLUCK WITH YOUR SKILLS! </b>
